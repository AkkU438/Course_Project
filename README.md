Welcome to BlackJack Simulator 2024 [FREE NO VIRUS] 

Hello, welcome to the BlackJack simulator. This program is used to closely resemble a real game of blackjack that you could play at a casino. To play the game is simple. Once you start, you have two cards and the dealer has two cards, one of which is visible to the players. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over by adding together the value of the cards you draw. The face cards equal 10, and the ace equals either one or 11 depending on which is most beneficial to you. However, the ace values are static. Once you have your two cards, you can decide whether or not you would like to hit or stand by selecting the designated button. If you end up with a score over 21 then you bust and lose. After this stage, the dealer then repeats this process and turns over their hidden card. Whoever is closer between the two of you wins. 

The purpose of this project is to provide quality family friendly entertainment to teach children the dangers of gambling from an early age. Even though blackjack is considered to be a more neutral game it is still difficult to consistently win, and our project can help show that. It also can be used to practice playing without the consquences of losing any money.
